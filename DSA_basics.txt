DSA Basics:

1. Binary Search: Algorithm used in sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval into half.

2. Breath First Search: Algorithm that starts traverse the graph from the root node & explores all the neighboring nodes.

3. Depth First Search: Algorithm traverse a graph in a depthward motion and uses a stack to remember.

4. Inorder Tree Traversal: In inorder, you traverse from left subtree to the root then to the right subtree.

5. Preorder Tree Traversal: In preorder, you traverse from the root to the left subtree then to the right subtree.

6. Postorder Tree Traversal: In postorder, you traverse from left of the subtree to the right of the subtree then to the root.
