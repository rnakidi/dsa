How to Design a System like Instagram?

Hereâ€™s a simple step-by-step approach to build the core functionality:

1 - Users perform an action on their device like tapping the like button, uploading a picture, or following another user.
2 - The request goes through a gateway to the backend server built using frameworks like Django, Express, or anything else.
3 - The data is stored in the database. 
- Structured data such as user profiles, comments, and relationships are stored in relational databases like Postgres. 
- Data items requiring high write throughput such as user feeds and activity logs can be stored in eventually consistent databases like Cassandra. 
- Frequently accessed data is stored in cache (for example, Redis or Memcached).

4 - Images and videos are stored in an object storage and corresponding metadata is stored in the database.
5 - Asynchronous tasks like sending notifications are sent to a queue.
6 - Background workers (like Celery) retrieve the task from the queue and perform the necessary processing.
7 - Celery worker also performs the necessary updates in the databases.
