Building Blocks for Scalable System Design

Building systems that work at scale? These four building blocks matter:

Scalability: Systems keep working as they grow. Add more power to servers (vertical scaling), run more copies (horizontal scaling), or break into smaller services (microservices).

Availability: Keep systems running when needed. Load balancers spread work, replicas maintain data copies, and failover systems kick in if something breaks.

Reliability: Deliver consistent results. Track everything with monitoring tools, handle errors gracefully between services, and catch bugs early with automated tests.

Performance: Stay fast even during peak times. Database indexing finds data quickly, caching serves frequent requests faster, and background workers handle heavy tasks.
