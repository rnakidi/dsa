Docker vs. Kubernetes. Which one should we use? 
. 
. 
What is Docker ? 
Docker is an open-source platform that allows you to package, distribute, and run applications in isolated containers. It focuses on containerization, providing lightweight environments that encapsulate applications and their dependencies. 
 
What is Kubernetes ? 
Kubernetes, often referred to as K8s, is an open-source container orchestration platform. It provides a framework for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications across a cluster of nodes. 
 
How are both different from each other ? 
Docker: Docker operates at the individual container level on a single operating system host. 
 
You must manually manage each host and setting up networks, security policies, and storage for multiple related containers can be complex. 
 
Kubernetes: Kubernetes operates at the cluster level. It manages multiple containerized applications across multiple hosts, providing automation for tasks like load balancing, scaling, and ensuring the desired state of applications. 
 
In short, Docker focuses on containerization and running containers on individual hosts, while Kubernetes specializes in managing and orchestrating containers at scale across a cluster of hosts.
