AWS Networking Architecture in One Diagram 

Networking is an important pillar of Tech
But it can seem complex.

This diagram breaks down a Typical AWS Network Architecture

AWS offers secure, scalable, and highly available networking solutions, enabling seamless connectivity between:

- The Internet
- Remote workers
- Corporate data centers
- The AWS ecosystem itself


Key Components to Know:

1. VPC (Virtual Private Cloud):
- The foundation of AWS networking. 
- Create a private, logically isolated environment to run your resources.

2. Availability Zones (AZs):
- Redundant data centers within a region to ensure high availability and resilience.

Let’s Walk Through AWS Network Connectivity:

Internet Gateway (IGW):
- Connect your VPC to the internet for bidirectional communication.

Client VPN Endpoint:
- Enable remote workers to securely access AWS resources or on-premises networks.

Virtual Gateway (VGW):
- Create a secure site-to-site VPN between your corporate data center and AWS.

VPC Peering:
- Directly connect two VPCs for private communication using IPv4 or IPv6.

Transit Gateway:
- A central hub to connect multiple VPCs, VPNs, or even AWS accounts.

VPC Endpoints:
- Gateway Endpoint: Private connections to services like S3 and DynamoDB.
- Interface Endpoint (PrivateLink): Secure connections to AWS services or SaaS applications.

Private Link:
- Enable private access to SaaS applications or services hosted on AWS.

 
Whether you’re transitioning into tech, earning certifications, or working on hands-on projects, understanding these components will take you far.
