⚠️ Exception Handling in Microservices: @ControllerAdvice and @RestControllerAdvice in Spring Boot ⚠️

In microservices architectures, exception handling must be well-structured to ensure standardized responses and improve the client experience. In Spring Boot, the @ControllerAdvice and @RestControllerAdvice annotations allow centralized error handling, reducing repetitive code and ensuring more consistent REST APIs.

🔹 Why Centralize Exception Handling?
● Standardization: Ensures all error responses follow a consistent format.
● Reduces Repetitive Code: Avoids the need to catch exceptions in every endpoint.
● Better Client Experience: Provides clear and structured error messages.

🔹 @ControllerAdvice vs. @RestControllerAdvice
● @ControllerAdvice:
⠀⠀⠀● Applies global error handling for traditional controllers (@Controller).
⠀⠀⠀● Can be used for HTML pages and non-JSON responses.
● @RestControllerAdvice:
⠀⠀⠀● Specialized for REST APIs, ensuring JSON responses.
⠀⠀⠀● Ideal for microservices and API-based applications.

🔹 Best Practices for Exception Handling
● Create Custom Exceptions:
⠀⠀⠀● Example: UserNotFoundException to indicate a missing user.
● Use Appropriate HTTP Status Codes:
⠀⠀⠀● 400 - Bad Request: Validation or malformed request errors.
⠀⠀⠀● 404 - Not Found: Resource not found.
⠀⠀⠀● 500 - Internal Server Error: Unexpected server errors.
● Return a Structured Error Object:
⠀⠀⠀● Include timestamp, HTTP code, message, and details.

✅ Benefits of Centralized Error Handling
● More predictable and easier-to-consume APIs.
● Cleaner, modular code, avoiding redundancy.
● Improved debugging and error logging.
Implementing centralized exception handling improves API maintainability and provides better error feedback to clients. 🚀
