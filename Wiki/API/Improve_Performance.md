20 Steps To Improving API Performance

🗂Compress API Responses: Enable Gzip or Brotli compression to decrease the size of the data transmitted over the network, speeding up response times.

📋Use Efficient Data Formats: Choose lightweight data formats like JSON or Protocol Buffers over XML to reduce payload size and parsing time.

🗒Implement Pagination: For APIs returning large datasets, use pagination to limit the number of records returned in a single request, improving response times and reducing load.

🧮Asynchronous Processing: Offload long-running operations to background processes or queues, allowing the API to respond quickly while processing tasks separately.

📎Rate Limiting: Implement rate limiting to control the number of requests a user can make in a given time frame, preventing abuse and ensuring fair usage.

🪛Optimize Network Settings: Adjust TCP parameters (like window size) and use HTTP/2 for improved connection management and faster request/response cycles.

🧲Load Balancing: Distribute incoming API requests across multiple servers to ensure no single server becomes a bottleneck, enhancing availability and reliability.

🩹Code Optimization: Review and refactor your code to eliminate inefficiencies, using best practices and design patterns for better performance.

🔧Proper Error Handling: Implement consistent error handling to avoid unnecessary resource consumption and provide meaningful feedback to clients.

🗳API Versioning: Use versioning to maintain compatibility with older clients while introducing new features, minimizing disruption during updates.

🗞Minimize Payload Size: Strip unnecessary fields from responses, and use techniques like data normalization to reduce the amount of data sent over the network.

🪚Use Appropriate Data Types: Choose the right data types for your database and API responses to minimize storage and transmission overhead.

🛡Implement Timeouts: Set appropriate timeouts for API requests and responses to prevent hanging connections and improve overall performance.

🖥Monitor and Profile: Continuously monitor API performance metrics and use profiling tools to identify bottlenecks and areas for improvement.

🔐Optimize Authentication: Use token-based authentication (like JWT) and consider caching authentication results to reduce overhead on each request.

⚙️Use Microservices Architecture: Break down monolithic applications into microservices to increase scalability and allow independent optimization of each service.

🔩Implement GraphQL: Consider using GraphQL to allow clients to request only the data they need, reducing over-fetching and under-fetching of data.

📱Optimize for Mobile: Design APIs with mobile clients in mind, focusing on minimizing data usage and optimizing for intermittent connectivity.
