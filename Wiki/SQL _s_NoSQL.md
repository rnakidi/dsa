SQL vs NoSQL - 7 Key Differences Every Developer Must Know:

1. 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐌𝐨𝐝𝐞𝐥
- SQL ➝ Stores data in structured tables with rows & columns.
- NoSQL ➝ Uses flexible data models like documents, key-value pairs, graphs, or wide columns.

2. 𝐒𝐜𝐚𝐥𝐚𝐛𝐢𝐥𝐢𝐭𝐲
SQL ➝ Primarily scales vertically by increasing the hardware resources (CPU, RAM, SSD) of a single server.
NoSQL ➝ Designed for Horizontal scaling (distributing data across multiple servers).

3. 𝐅𝐥𝐞𝐱𝐢𝐛𝐢𝐥𝐢𝐭𝐲 & 𝐒𝐜𝐡𝐞𝐦𝐚
SQL ➝ Strict schema; every table has a predefined structure.
NoSQL ➝ Typically uses a dynamic schema; easily handles unstructured or semi-structured data.

4. 𝐐𝐮𝐞𝐫𝐲 𝐋𝐚𝐧𝐠𝐮𝐚𝐠𝐞
SQL ➝ Uses Structured Query Language (SQL) to perform complex queries across multiple tables.
NoSQL ➝ No standard language; varies by database (e.g., MongoDB uses JSON-based queries).

5. 𝐓𝐫𝐚𝐧𝐬𝐚𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬 & 𝐀𝐂𝐈𝐃 𝐂𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐢𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞
SQL ➝ Provides strong support for ACID transactions (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability).
NoSQL ➝ Prioritizes high availability & speed over strong ACID compliance.

6. 𝐏𝐞𝐫𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞
SQL ➝ Optimized for structured data, complex queries and joins across multiple tables.
NoSQL ➝ Faster for large-scale applications with high write/read speeds.

7. 𝐔𝐬𝐞 𝐂𝐚𝐬𝐞𝐬
SQL ➝ Best for banking, finance, e-commerce, and applications needing complex queries and strict consistency.
NoSQL ➝ Best for real-time analytics, big data, IoT, and fast-growing applications like social media.
