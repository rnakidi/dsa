During my JP Morgan's time, I learnt a lot about Microservices architecture. Most of my learning came from hands-on experience and that helped me to connect back to a number of patterns, later.

Microservices architecture is all about scalability, resilience, and efficiency, but without the right design patterns, things can get messy fast!

Here are 12 essential microservices patterns, I think every developer can learn and benefit from:

1. API Gateway Pattern – A single entry point that routes requests to the right microservice.
2. Saga Pattern – Breaks distributed transactions into smaller steps with compensating actions.
3. Event Sourcing Pattern – Stores all changes as a sequence of events instead of just the latest state.
4. CQRS – Separates read and write operations for better scalability and performance.
5. Strangler Fig Pattern – Gradually replaces monolithic applications with microservices.
6. Service Discovery Pattern – Automatically finds and connects microservices without hardcoded addresses.
7. Circuit Breaker Pattern – Stops a failing service from overloading the system by blocking further calls.
