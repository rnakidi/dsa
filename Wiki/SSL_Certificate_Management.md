SSL Certificate management is really important for a Devops Engineer. Let's break down some key terms.

Certificate Authority (CA): A trusted entity that issues and validates TLS certificates.

TLS Certificate: A digital credential that verifies the identity of a server or client, ensuring encrypted and authenticated communication.

Private Key: A secret key tied to a specific certificate, used by a server or client to prove its identity.

Public Key: The non-secret part of a certificateâ€™s key pair. It can be shared openly and is used by others to verify signatures and encrypt data for the entity holding the corresponding private key.

Secret Object: Kubernetes resource used to store TLS certificates and keys securely, often referenced by Ingress controllers and workloads.

cert-manager: A popular Kubernetes add-on that automates the creation, renewal, and management of TLS certificates.
