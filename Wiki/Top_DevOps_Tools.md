Repositories are essential to CI and CD. Beyond being the endpoint of the check-in and test process, software repositories are the preferred place to store your CI and CD scripts and configuration files. Yes, many of the CI/CD platforms can store scripts and other files internally, but you are usually better off having them in version control outside of the tool.

Each programming language tends to have its own build tools and testing tools. To be useful to you, a CI/CD tool must support all the languages that are part of a given project. Otherwise, you might need to write one or more plug-ins for the tool. Docker images are becoming more and more critical to distributed, modular, and microservice software deployments. It helps a lot if your CI/CD tool knows how to deal with Docker images, including creating an image from your source code, binaries, and prerequisites, and deploying an image to a specific environment.

The principles of CI and CD may seem obvious, but the details are not. The various CI/CD tools have differing levels of support and documentation. For example, multiple books on Jenkins aren’t surprising since it’s the oldest. For other products, you may have to investigate the documentation, support forums, and paid support options as part of your due diligence in picking a tool.

While this guide is about choosing a CI/CD platform, don’t assume one platform will be optimal for all your software development projects.

In general, cloud container deployments are less expensive than cloud server instance deployments, and serverless cloud deployments are less expensive than container deployments.
