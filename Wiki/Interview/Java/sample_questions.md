Java Developer Interview Questions for Experienced: https://algomaster.io/practice/dsa-patterns

1.     You need to handle 1 million requests per second. How would you scale your backend architecture?
2.     If you are building an order management system, how would you design the services? (Database choices, API interactions, scalability)
3.     Design a simple service that asynchronously processes tasks using Spring Boot.
4.     You have a distributed system where one Microservice must call another but should retry on failure. How would you implement this in Spring Boot?
5.     You deployed a Spring Boot service, but it crashes with an "Out of Memory" error. How do you debug this?
6.     Your Spring Boot REST API, which fetches data from a database, suddenly becomes slow. The response time has increased from 100ms to 3 seconds.
7.     Your Spring Boot microservice is running on Kubernetes and after a few hours, it crashes with OutOfMemoryError.
·       What are the possible causes of memory leaks in Java?
·       How to find which objects are causing the memory leak?
·       How to use a profiler (like JVisualVM, YourKit) to detect leaks?

8.     One of your microservices has started consuming high CPU (90%), even though the incoming traffic is normal.
·       How to investigate and identify the root cause?
·       What could cause a thread to enter an infinite loop?
·        How can you profile CPU usage in a running application?

9.     You start your Spring Boot application, but it fails with a "BeanCurrentlyInCreationException" due to a circular dependency.
·       How to debug and fix this issue?
·       What Spring mechanisms help break circular dependencies?

10.  Your Spring Boot app occasionally freezes and stops processing requests.
·       How to detect a deadlock in Java?
·       How can you use jstack to diagnose the issue?
·       How can you avoid deadlocks in database transactions?

If I had to start DSA preparation from scratch, then this will be the roadmap I would follow.
 
1. Understand basics of data-structures.

2. Understand time and space complexity.

3. Learn different basic algorithms (sorting, searching, BFS, DFS, etc.,) .

4. Use Visualgo for better visualization of the algorithm working.

5. Start with Blind 75 questions from Neetcode. This will give the foundation of problem solving in various topics.

6. Learn the patterns in various topics, this will help you recognize the pattern and help you solve the questions better.

7. Then gradually move to Neetcode 150 from the neetocde.io from Navdeep Singh.

8. Also If you are preparing for interviews, it is good to have a mock interviews. (I recommend my friend Sairam M who provides actionable feedbacks that helps you to crack FAANG level companies).

9. The last and never ending step is Keep Practicing more and more question, as that is the only way to keep yourself sharp.

All this I mentioned above can take a time span of 6-7 months. If you are trying to complete in a couple of months, then you are going to exhaust your brain.
