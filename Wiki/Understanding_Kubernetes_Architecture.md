Understanding Kubernetes Architecture:

Kubernetes, or K8s, is a powerful container orchestration tool designed to manage, scale, and deploy containerized applications seamlessly. Let’s break down its architecture into simple components:

1. Control Plane :
This is the brain of the cluster, responsible for managing the entire system. It consists of :-

* Kube-API Server: Acts as the communication hub. It exposes the Kubernetes API and processes RESTful requests.

* ETCD: A key-value store where the cluster’s state and configuration data are stored.

* Scheduler: Assigns pods to nodes based on resource requirements and availability.
* Controller Manager: Ensures the desired state of the cluster by managing controllers like Node, Deployment, and Endpoint controllers.
* Cloud Controller Manager: Handles interactions between Kubernetes and cloud providers for services like load balancing and storage.

2. Data Plane (Nodes/Worker Machines)
Nodes run the actual workloads in the form of pods. Key components include :-

* Kubelet: Ensures containers are running as per the pod specifications.

* Kube-Proxy: Maintains networking rules to allow communication between services.
* Pods: The smallest deployable unit, which can run one or more containers.

3. Cluster
The cluster is the combination of the control plane and the data plane, working together to manage resources and ensure applications run smoothly.
K8s integrates seamlessly with cloud provider APIs for additional functionality like storage and scaling.
With this robust design, Kubernetes ensures high availability, scalability, and reliability for containerized applications.
