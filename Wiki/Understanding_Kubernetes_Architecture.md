Understanding Kubernetes Architecture:

Kubernetes, or K8s, is a powerful container orchestration tool designed to manage, scale, and deploy containerized applications seamlessly. Let’s break down its architecture into simple components:

1. Control Plane :
This is the brain of the cluster, responsible for managing the entire system. It consists of :-

* Kube-API Server: Acts as the communication hub. It exposes the Kubernetes API and processes RESTful requests.

* ETCD: A key-value store where the cluster’s state and configuration data are stored.

* Scheduler: Assigns pods to nodes based on resource requirements and availability.
* Controller Manager: Ensures the desired state of the cluster by managing controllers like Node, Deployment, and Endpoint controllers.
* Cloud Controller Manager: Handles interactions between Kubernetes and cloud providers for services like load balancing and storage.

2. Data Plane (Nodes/Worker Machines)
Nodes run the actual workloads in the form of pods. Key components include :-

* Kubelet: Ensures containers are running as per the pod specifications.

* Kube-Proxy: Maintains networking rules to allow communication between services.
* Pods: The smallest deployable unit, which can run one or more containers.

3. Cluster
The cluster is the combination of the control plane and the data plane, working together to manage resources and ensure applications run smoothly.
K8s integrates seamlessly with cloud provider APIs for additional functionality like storage and scaling.
With this robust design, Kubernetes ensures high availability, scalability, and reliability for containerized applications.

This architecture describes deploying a microservices application on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). AKS is a managed Kubernetes service that makes deploying, managing, and scaling containerized applications easy.

The architecture consists of the following components:

✅AKS cluster: The AKS cluster is the foundation of the architecture. It provides the infrastructure for running the microservices application.

✅Virtual network: The virtual network isolates the AKS cluster from the rest of the Azure network. It also provides a private network for the microservices application to communicate with each other.

✅Ingress controller: The ingress controller is responsible for routing traffic to the different microservices in the application.

✅Azure Load Balancer: The Azure Load Balancer distributes traffic evenly across the nodes in the AKS cluster.

✅Azure Container Registry: The Azure Container Registry is a private Docker registry for storing the Docker images for the microservices application.

✅Azure Pipelines: Azure Pipelines is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) service that can be used to build, test, and deploy the microservices application to AKS.

✅Helm: Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that can be used to manage the Kubernetes manifests for the microservices application.

✅Azure Monitor: Azure Monitor collects and stores metrics, logs, and traces for the microservices application. It can be used to monitor the health of the application and troubleshoot problems.

𝐃𝐞𝐩𝐥𝐨𝐲𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐜𝐞𝐬𝐬:

The following steps describe the process for deploying a microservices application to AKS using this architecture:

☑️Create an AKS cluster.
☑️Create a virtual network for the AKS cluster.
☑️Deploy the ingress controller to the AKS cluster.
☑️Create an Azure Load Balancer.
☑️Create an Azure Container Registry.
☑️Push the Docker images for the microservices application to the Azure Container Registry.
☑️Create a Helm chart for the microservices application.
